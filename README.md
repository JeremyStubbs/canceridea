**Abstract**

There is a large unmet need for metastatic cancer therapy. The current leading strategy is immune-regulating antibodies. Cell therapies are under development. A combination of antibodies and cell therapies will be better than either alone. The most cost-effective union will be based on chimeric Fcγ receptors. Multiple cell lines may have synergistic effects.

**Introduction**

Antibodies are first-line for many metastatic solid tumors. The most effective target PD-1 ligands and CTLA-4 that tumors secrete which inhibit the immune system, however some antibodies target overexpressed surface antigens, such as Herceptin. Similarly, blinatumomab is Bispecific T-cell Engager (BITE, the only FDA approved BITE) and is first line for some blood cancers.

CAR T cells have found success in blood cancers similar to anti-PD-1 and CTLA-4 antibodies in solid cancers. The 5-year overall survival of CD-19 targeting CAR T cell therapy for lymphoma/leukemia is 40-60%. \[28, 29, 33\] However, given the costs of CAR T cell therapy, surface antigen targeting antibodies and blinatumomab are currently first line for many blood cancers and are given to many more patients than CAR T cells. \[31, 32\]

Surface antigen targeting antibodies are the SOC for many solid tumors – Cetuximab and Trastuzumab to name a few. \[34, 35\]. Unfortunately, these are only marginally effective.

Why do antibodies produce a better response than CAR T cells in solid tumors? I think it’s because they activate a wide range of cells (T cells, NK cells, B cells, and granulocytes) that can better coordinate a response in the complex tumor environment. Could engineered cells increase antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC)? I think yes.

I think if you made immune cells with chimeric IgG Fc receptors in which the external domains (which would bind the Fc region of IgG) linked to enough known activating pathways for that cell, you could drive it to kill cancer. This technology is called chimeric Fcγ receptors (CFcγR). It is a variation of BITE technology. CFcγR engineering has already been accomplished by Sconocchia et al \[25\] but I generalize this to multiple engineered Fc receptors or other immune cells besides T cells. I also introduce the possibility of using antibody-drug complexes (ADCs). This was actually my original idea, and I ended up working backwards toward chimeric Fcγ receptor technology. Tumor specificity (one of the hardest parts of solid tumor therapy) is enhanced by chemistry not biochemistry because the cells are specifically engineered to have an increased response to the molecules carried/released by the ADCs.

The benefit of using an IgG intermediary over CAR-based therapies is that it removes the need to engineer each pathway on each cell line for each patient’s unique cancer surface markers. Thus, the cells would be the same for every patient. This is potentially cheaper than CAR-based cells. I imagine a future in which there are thousands of anti-cancer antibodies, and you can screen to see which ones bind the patient’s particular cancer phenotype. Since the cells recognize the stable Fc portion, the same interchangeable cells with the antibodies form a personalized cancer therapy.

This strategy could be used with NK cells, macrophages, neutrophils and other cells. Great advances have been made in producing immune cells from pluripotent stem cells which can be grown and cultured ex vivo. In the future, off the shelf cells will be available that are interchangeable from patient to patient and would not require costly CRISPR-CAS9-based genetic modifications for each patient.

The engineering of an CFcγR is not too dissimilar to a CAR. A CAR T cell uses an antibody fragment bound to transmembrane CD3 (the final target of the T cell receptor). \[30\] What I suggest is that this antibody fragment should be specific for the Fc region of IgG, and the external domain should be linked to other transmembrane protein signal transducers as well. Lastly, further activation of the engineered cells could be accomplished by using ADCs instead of regular antibodies if the cells are specifically engineered to have an increased response to the molecules carried/released by the ADCs.

**The Strategy:**

Most immune cells require multiple signals to become activated. \[3\] The solid tumor environment is highly immune-inhibitory and difficult to access. \[3\] I think if you had antibodies signal through enough pathways and if the cells were mutated to ignore the tumor signals, you could activate them in the tumor.

What cells to use? T cells offer extremely effective targeted cytotoxicity. They clearly have a role. Granulocytes offer the possibility of a messy attack which would help overcome tumor heterogeneity. Whereas T cells are like snipers, a granulocyte is like a bomb that would hit the target cell and everything around it. Lastly engineered B cells could amplify local antibody concentrations in the vicinity of the tumors in response to those very antibodies. Of all these cells, the easiest Fcγ chimeric receptor to make is probably the B cell because the external domain of the B cell receptor already is an antibody fragment.

What pathways would you link the Fc receptor to? It depends on the cell line. But in general, their main activating signals and other stimulatory pathways.

1) For CD8 T cells, you could conjugate the external Fc receptor to CD3 like Sconocchia et al. You could also target the co-receptors used by helper T cells. For B cells, you might target the B cell receptor and its co-receptors. For granulocytes you could target innate immune pathways. For example, you might link the Fc binding domain to a bacterial epitope receptor internal domain like the TLR receptor for lipopolysaccharide (TLR4).

2) Antibodies alone are a strong activation signal for immune cells. You might retain some native Fc receptors in these cells. The Fc region of IgG is remarkably consistent between people, but you must ensure that these cells are not activated by all the other antibodies in the blood. You will need to use an IgG with a modified Fc peptide sequence and mutate the engineered cells FcγR’s external domain to respond only to this modified sequence.  

3) The cells could also be modified to tolerate the tumor microenvironment’s suppressive signals. I would try to knock out a gene for one or more of the known immunosuppressive signaling molecules like PD-1 ligand receptor, CTLA-4. There are a variety of other potential targets that could include receptors for IL-1β, TGF-β/NF-κB and IL-6. Hypoxia-inducible factor pathway might also be altered. Heat-shock proteins (HSP) are often secreted by cancer cells and inhibit immune cells, so you might also make cells non-reactive to extracellular HSPs. \[3, 4, 8\]  

4) You might also increase the effectiveness of the cells by making them produce certain molecules in response to the antibodies: 1. Chemokines 2. Cytokines 3. Exotoxins. Chemokines would attract other immune cells. Cytokines would augment the endogenous immune response to antibodies in the vicinity of the tumor.  

Common CD8 T cell cytokines are TNF, TGF-B, IL-12, IL-6, and IL-2. Engleman showed that neutrophils infiltrate and eliminate cancer when TNF + CD40 agonist + anti-tumor antibodies injected into tumors. \[24\] For neutrophils and eosinophils, I would focus on C3a, C5, IL-5, GMCSF, IFN and TNF.  

Taking it a step further you could mutate the cytokine receptors on these cells to respond to antibodies although that seems physically impossible. Cytokines and chemokines often signal through JAK-STAT pathways. JAK phosphorylation catalyzes downstream dimerization and signaling. You might connect these to the Fc receptor by creating create cross-talk between PI3K (the Fc signal transducer) and STAT (the cytokine signal transducer) proteins.

5) Lastly, you want these cells to live long enough in the patient’s body to do their work. There are many surface protein/glycoprotein markers that determine long-term compatibility of exogenous cells. The main histocompatibility markers are HLA-1 and HLA-2. HLA 1 knockout cells have been created which are widely compatible much like the O blood type. \[26\] There are far fewer combinations of HLA 2 which would make creating or finding a matched cell line much easier. Of course, HLA 2 could also be knocked out. Of course, you could simultaneously treat the patient with steroids to prevent autoimmune attack of these cells.

How would you accomplish all this engineering? With CRISPR or zinc-fingers and other standard genetic engineering strategies.

In summary, in response to IgG the cells would activate multiple pathways and become activated to attack that to which the antibodies are bound. The right combination of signals will activate the cells against the cancer. Multiple antibodies should be used with multiple cell lines (namely T cells, neutrophils, and B cells) simultaneously. The antibodies will localize to a tumor and whenever one of these cells encounters enough of these antibodies, they will perform the desired function better than an endogenous cell which only signals through the canonical Fcγ pathway.

**Other Considerations**

The cells must be replication deficient. That could be accomplished with mature terminally-differentiate cells like hybridoma cells (leukemia) dependent on a growth factor in media although that seems a little risky. Efforts are already underway to develop anti-cancer cell therapies from iPSCs – this seems more likely. \[3, 7, 13, 14, 36\] Furthermore, systems have been developed to efficiently use CRISPR on T cells, B cells and granulocytes. \[10, 15-17\]

**The Argument for Granulocytes:**

The different cell lines must first be tested in vitro to determine which CFcγRs to use for each cell line. Then you might try each individual cell line in vivo before trying the near infinite combinations of receptor targets with multiple kinds of cells. It is a given that T cells and B cells will have a role. The role of granulocytes also require explanation.

Granulocytes are the major white blood cell fraction. The three varieties of granulocytes are neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils. Morphologically, the cells are similar, ranging in size from 12 to 17 µm with multi-lobed nuclei. Their cytoplasms contain granules whose eponymous staining pattern differentiates them. Degranulation only occurs under the right conditions and is part of the mechanism by which they accomplish their functions. \[3, 4, 8, 11, 12\] Neutrophils are the most numerous. They are associated with phagocytosis and various cytotoxic and immunostimulatory actions in purulent infections. Eosinophils are best known for their activities against helminth infections and in allergic reactions. Basophils and mast cells are best known for their roles in allergic reactions. \[3\] But there is a great deal of overlap in the immune system and these cells are multifunctional. Degranulation is the process in which the contents of vast numbers of granules are released simultaneously. Eosinophils use it to attack a large multicellular helminth infection. \[21\] Neutrophils are classically activated against bacterial infections. See figures 2 and 3. But there is a great deal of overlap in the immune system and many groups are trying to harness these to attack cancer cells.

Degranulation offers a unique ability of a messy attack. Whereas T cells are targeted killers, a granulocyte is like a bomb that would hit the target cell and everything around it. This confers the possibly of breaking through the extracellular matrix which usually prevents the access of immune cells to tumors. This might work better in conjunction with other immune cells. One way to visualize it is, the granulocytes would knock down the door (C4) and let the T-cells enter to perform a targeted attack (Navy seals).

Eosinophils should get the same amount of funding as neutrophils because there is reason to believe that they are just as promising. \[23\] Eosinophils live longer (up to seven days versus 24 hours in neutrophils) and their granules are less heterogeneous than those of neutrophils. MBP comprises 50% of their granule content which represents a single alterable target that could be replaced with a more cytotoxic protein. \[3, 4\] For example, the genes for granule proteins could be replaced with another more toxic protein like perforin, granzyme and/or pseudomonas exotoxin. CRISPR could be used to edit the genes. Granularity allows for production of an exotoxin because it would be safely segregated from the rest of the cell.

**Discussion**

Multiple solid tumors are known to overexpress cell surface receptors. There are over 50 FDA approved monoclonal antibody therapies for cancer. \[5, 8, 9, 18\] How do we increase their effectiveness? I think the answer is multiple immune cell lines with engineered Chimeric Fcγ receptors. With the right combination of CFcγR cells, their functions will be synergistic which is needed to overcome the complexity of the tumor environment: T cells, B cells, and granulocytes (neutrophils and eosinophils).

These cells would have transmembrane fusion proteins in which an IgG Fc-binding external domain transduces the signal via several different stimulatory pathways, e.g. the cell’s main activation pathways, and the endogenous Fc pathway. One could make the cells more tolerant to the tumor environment. Hypothetically, you could also make these cells respond to antibody-drug complexes in addition to regular antibodies.

I imagine a future in which there are thousands of anti-cancer antibodies, and you can screen to see which ones bind the patient’s particular cancer phenotype. Since the cells recognize the stable Fc portion, once the cells are made, all you must do is screen the patient’s tumors for antibody binding. Each antibody must be tested to ensure that they do not target any “normal” proteins in the body. But I think cancer patients would be willing to take a little risk to treat their cancer, and I think they should be allowed to try experimental antibodies before extensive testing is complete.

It would be near impossible to develop such a library of CAR T cells (and other cell lines). Even if you did, an empirical approach would require a massive cellular assay to find the right CARs for each patient. Anyway, it’s not like adding a single spacer molecule (the antibody) is really guaranteed to throw a monkey wrench in the whole thing. The wise course of action is to work on both CAR cells and CFcγRs concurrently.

The biggest problem with an antibody-based therapy is getting a higher local concentration of antibodies around the tumor (both injected and produced by the modified B cells) than in the serum. This results from an increased number of cell surface markers which is not guaranteed. Your engineered cells must only produce cytotoxic response above a threshold which is only present at a tumor.

What about losing the endogenous immune response? The Fc receptor on endogenous immune cells won’t recognize these modified Fc regions. A possible solution is to alternate: one week you give modified antibodies and the engineered cells that respond to them; the next you give normal IgG antibodies that the endogenous immune system recognizes.

You would also need to make modifications to make the cells tolerate the tumor environment and not get attacked by the patient’s immune system.

Clearly this is a massive proposal. This would require significant funding and the concerted effort of many scientists and engineers, but I think it is worth it.

Obviously this must first be done in vitro to determine which CFcγRs to use for each cell line. Then you might try each individual cell line in vivo before trying the near infinite combinations of receptor targets with multiple kinds of cells.
