**Abstract**

Metastatic cancer remains a significant clinical challenge with limited therapeutic options. While immune-regulating antibodies and cell therapies show promise, combining these modalities may yield superior outcomes. Chimeric Fcγ receptors (CFcγRs) offer a scalable and cost-effective alternative to CAR T cells by leveraging interchangeable immune cells responsive to antibody therapies. This approach involves engineering multiple CFcγRs across various immune cell types to achieve synergistic anti-cancer effects. By pairing CFcγR-expressing cells with a library of anti-cancer antibodies tailored to individual tumor phenotypes, I envision a universal, off-the-shelf cancer immunotherapy. Advances in universal donor cell technology and immunosuppressive strategies further enhance the feasibility of this personalized yet scalable treatment paradigm.

**Introduction**

The SOC for many metastatic solid tumors is immune stimulating antibodies that target PD-1 ligands and CTLA-4. However multiple solid tumors are known to overexpress cell surface receptors and there are over 50 FDA approved monoclonal antibody therapies for cancer. \[5, 8, 9, 18\] Some commonly used antibodies that target overexpressed surface antigens are Cetuximab and Trastuzumab. Similarly, Bispecific T-cell Engager (BITEs) are a promising prospect under development and already first line for some blood cancers e.g. blinatumomab. \[34, 35\]

There are multiple other options to stimulate the immune system to target cancer cells: mRNA vaccines, intratumoral therapies (virus-based and immunostimulant-based). There is evidence that all of these enhance the effect of immune-stimulating antibodies (T-VEC, SD-101, RP1, mrna-4157) in multiple ongoing clinical trials. \[39\] Another option is antibody-drug complexes (ADCs). Surely, many more combinations of these will prove successful in the future.

CAR T cells have found success in blood cancers. The 5-year overall survival of CD-19 targeting CAR T cell therapy for lymphoma/leukemia is 40-60%. \[28, 29, 33\] However, given the costs of CAR T cell therapy, their use is restricted to refractory cases. \[31, 32\] Why haven’t they been effective in solid tumors like immunostimulant-based approaches? Tumor specificity is one of the hardest parts of solid tumor therapy.

I think that current immune-activating approaches work better than CAR cells in solid tumors because they recruit a wide range of cells (T cells, NK cells, B cells, and granulocytes) that can better coordinate a response in the complex tumor environment. Could engineered cells work better than endogenous cells which are currently used by immune activating approaches? Yes, but we need to go back to a technology originally explored by some of the leaders in CAR technology.

This technology is called chimeric Fcγ receptors (CFcγR).

Eshhar and colleagues developed chimeric Fc gamma receptor T cells in 1989 to study the activating pathways of T cells \[38\]. He later focused on the development of CAR T cells. Margo Roberts and Mitchell Finer published an article in 1998 in which they describe the creation of a neutrophil with chimeric Fc gamma receptors \[37\]. Like Eshhar, they later abandoned this idea in favor of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and successfully brought the first CAR T cells to market and have collaborated on multiple biotech company to develop CARs including Cell Genesys, Unity Bio, Appia Bio, and Elevated Bio. More recently, chimeric Fcγ receptors engineering was accomplished by Sconocchia et al \[25\]. He too chose to focus on CAR T cells.

Given the successes so far, it is natural to choose CAR technology over chimeric Fc gamma receptors. One clear benefit is CARs are endogenous cells and there is no concern for rejection. But I think that chimeric Fcγ receptors are still a good idea. I make no limitation on the signal transduction domain. It could be an Fc receptor or it could be something entirely different like those explored in BITE technology. The key is to engineer cells that respond optimally when the target binds the linker molecule (chimeric or custom antibody) which has an antibody Fv motif.

The benefit of using chimeric Fcγ receptors over CAR-based therapies is that it removes the need to engineer each cell line for each patient’s unique cancer surface markers. The cells would be the same for every patient. It is much cheaper to screen a surgical tumor sample to identify antibodies that bind to it than build unique CAR-based cells for each patient. Therefore, this approach is more likely to address tumor heterogeneity at scale.

There has been incredible progress in developing universal cells for transplantation and immunotherapy. Advancements in biotechnology have made this nearly a reality. Plus, I don’t think anyone has considered the practical possibility that only a physician would recognize, you can treat a patient with steroids and other drugs to prevent rejection of imperfectly matched transplants. The combination of new biotechnology directed at making universal cells and active immunosuppression may create an entirely new avenue of cancer treatment. Keep in mind you only need the cells to live for a short period of time to perform their function, so you don’t need to keep the patient immunosuppressed.

**The Strategy:**

I further generalize this approach twofold: 1. Multiple immune cells including T cells. 2. On each cell, multiple engineered internal targets.

I imagine a future in which there are thousands of anti-cancer antibodies, and you can screen a tumor sample to see which ones bind the patient’s particular cancer phenotype. CAR cells cannot address tumor heterogeneity as practically. Since the cells recognize the same Fc portion, the same cells could be used for all patients.

This strategy could be used with T cells, NK cells, macrophages, neutrophils, B cells and other cells. Great advances have been made in producing immune cells from pluripotent stem cells which can be grown and cultured ex vivo. In the future, off the shelf cells will be available that are interchangeable from patient to patient.

Taking it a step further (possibly into dreamland), you could engineer cells to respond not just to antibodies but also the molecules carried by ADCs.

The Fc region of IgG is remarkably consistent between people, but you must ensure that these cells are not activated by all the other antibodies in the blood. You will need to use an IgG with a modified Fc peptide sequence and mutate the engineered cells FcγR’s external domain to respond only to this modified sequence.

Most immune cells require multiple signals to become activated. \[3\] The solid tumor environment is highly immune-inhibitory and difficult to access. \[3\] Significant engineering needs to be done for each cell line.

What cells to use? T and NK cells offer extremely effective targeted cytotoxicity. They clearly have a role. Granulocytes offer the possibility of a messy attack which would help overcome tumor heterogeneity. Whereas T cells are like snipers, a granulocyte is like a bomb that would hit the target cell and everything around it. Lastly engineered B cells could further activate those cells in the vicinity of the tumors in response to those very antibodies.

**Specific Targets**

In general, you should link the Fc receptor to their main activating signals and other stimulatory pathways. You must also make the cells tolerant to the tumor environment and not get attacked by the patient’s immune system.

1) For CD8 T cells, you could conjugate the Fc receptor to CD3. You could also link it to the co-receptors that bind helper T cells. For B cells, you might target the B cell receptor and its co-receptors. For granulocytes you could target innate immune pathways. For example, you might link the Fc binding domain to a TLR receptor (like TLR4 for lipopolysaccharide). For NK cells, consider CD16, NKG2D, NKp30.

2) Antibodies alone are a strong activation signal for immune cells. You might retain some native Fc receptors in these cells.  

3) The cells could also be modified to tolerate the tumor microenvironment’s suppressive signals. I would try to knock out a gene for one or more of the known immunosuppressive signaling molecules. Options include receptors for the PD-1 ligand and CTLA-4. There are a variety of other potential targets that could include receptors for IL-1β, TGF-β/NF-κB and IL-6. Hypoxia-inducible factor pathway might also be altered. Heat-shock proteins (HSP) are often secreted by cancer cells and inhibit immune cells. \[3, 4, 8\] There are many options.  

4) Taking it a step further, cytokines and chemokines often signal through JAK-STAT pathways. JAK phosphorylation catalyzes downstream dimerization and signaling. You might connect these to the Fc receptor by cross-linking it to PI3K (the Fc signal transducer) or STAT (the cytokine signal transducer).

5) You might also increase the effectiveness of the cells by making them produce certain molecules in response to the antibodies: 1. Chemokines 2. Cytokines 3. Exotoxins. Chemokines would attract other immune cells. Cytokines would augment the endogenous immune response to antibodies in the vicinity of the tumor. Common CD8 T cell cytokines are TNF, TGF-B, IL-12, IL-6, and IL-2. Engleman showed that neutrophils infiltrate and eliminate cancer when TNF + CD40 agonist + anti-tumor antibodies injected into tumors. \[24\] For neutrophils and eosinophils, I would focus on C3a, C5, IL-5, GMCSF, IFN and TNF.

6) Lastly, you want these cells to live long enough in the patient’s body to do their work. There are many surface protein/glycoprotein markers that determine long-term compatibility of exogenous cells. The main histocompatibility markers are HLA-1 and HLA-2. HLA 1 knockout cells have been created which are widely compatible much like the O blood type. \[26\] There are far fewer combinations of HLA 2 which would make creating or finding a matched cell line much easier. The key is not to lose function. With a steroid pretreatment, you could probably make universal cells.

This could all be accomplished with CRISPR or zinc-fingers and other standard genetic engineering strategies.

The cells must be replication deficient. That could be accomplished with mature terminally-differentiate cells like hybridoma cells (leukemia) dependent on a growth factor in media although that seems a little risky. Efforts are already underway to develop anti-cancer cell therapies from iPSCs – this seems more likely. \[3, 7, 13, 14, 36\] Furthermore, systems have been developed to efficiently use CRISPR on T cells, B cells and granulocytes. \[10, 15-17\]

In summary, in response to IgG the cells would activate multiple pathways on multiple heavily engineered cells. These would coordinate an attack on the tumor to which the antibodies are bound.

**The Argument for Granulocytes:**

It is a given that T cells, NK cells and B cells probably have a role. Although granulocyte are not canonically anti-cancer cells, I think they have great potential in this regard.

Granulocytes are the major white blood cell fraction. The three varieties of granulocytes are neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils. Morphologically, the cells are similar, ranging in size from 12 to 17 µm with multi-lobed nuclei. Their cytoplasms contain granules whose eponymous staining pattern differentiates them. Degranulation only occurs under the right conditions and is part of the mechanism by which they accomplish their functions. \[3, 4, 8, 11, 12\] Neutrophils are the most numerous. They are associated with phagocytosis and various cytotoxic and immunostimulatory actions in purulent infections. Eosinophils are best known for their activities against helminth infections and in allergic reactions. Basophils and mast cells are best known for their roles in allergic reactions. \[3\] But there is a great deal of overlap in the immune system and these cells are multifunctional. Degranulation is the process in which the contents of vast numbers of granules are released simultaneously. Eosinophils use it to attack a large multicellular helminth infection. \[21\] Neutrophils are classically activated against bacterial infections. See figures 2 and 3. But there is a great deal of overlap in the immune system and many groups are trying to harness these to attack cancer cells.

Degranulation offers a unique ability of a messy attack. Whereas T cells are targeted killers, a granulocyte is like a bomb that would hit the target cell and everything around it. This confers the possibly of breaking through the extracellular matrix which usually prevents the access of immune cells to tumors. This might work better in conjunction with other immune cells. One way to visualize it is, the granulocytes would knock down the door (C4) and let the T-cells enter to perform a targeted attack (Navy seals).

Eosinophils should get the same amount of funding as neutrophils because there is reason to believe that they are just as promising. \[23\] Eosinophils live longer (up to seven days versus 24 hours in neutrophils) and their granules are less heterogeneous than those of neutrophils. MBP comprises 50% of their granule content which represents a single alterable target that could be replaced with a more cytotoxic protein. \[3, 4\] For example, the genes for granule proteins could be replaced with another more toxic protein like perforin, granzyme and/or pseudomonas exotoxin. CRISPR could be used to edit the genes. Granularity allows for production of an exotoxin because it would be safely segregated from the rest of the cell.

**Discussion**

Multiple solid tumors are known to overexpress cell surface receptors. There are over 50 FDA approved monoclonal antibody therapies for cancer. \[5, 8, 9, 18\] How do we increase their effectiveness? I think the answer is a combination of engineering the antibodies themselves and multiple immune cell lines to respond to the chimeric antibodies. I make no limitation on the cellular binding domain. It could be an Fc region like in chimeric Fcγ receptor technology or it could be something entirely different like BITE technology. The key is to engineer the cells so that it responds optimally to whatever motif is attached to the antibody Fv regions. With the right combination of cells, their functions will be synergistic which is needed to overcome the complexity of the tumor environment: T cells, NK cells, B cells, and granulocytes (neutrophils and eosinophils).

These cells would have transmembrane fusion proteins transduce the signal via several different stimulatory pathways: the cell’s main activation pathways, the endogenous Fc pathway, and/or other pathways. The cells would be engineered to tolerate the tumor environment. Hypothetically, you could also make these cells respond to antibody-drug complexes in addition to regular antibodies.

I imagine a future in which there are thousands of anti-cancer antibodies, and you can screen to see which ones bind each patient’s heterogenous tumors from a surgical sample. Since all the cells recognize the Fc portion which doesn’t change, the challenge is making these cells work in all patients, which I think is feasible.

It would be near impossible to develop such a library of CAR T cells (and other cell lines). Even if you did, an empirical approach would require a massive cellular assay to find the right CARs for each patient. Anyway, it’s not like adding a single spacer molecule (the antibody) is really guaranteed to throw a monkey wrench in the whole thing.

The biggest problem with an antibody-based therapy is getting a higher local concentration of antibodies around the tumor, but you have the same problem of getting activity only at the tumor and not at normal cells with CAR approaches too. Each antibody must be tested to ensure that they do not target any “normal” proteins in the body. But I think cancer patients would be willing to take a little risk to treat their cancer, and I think they should be allowed to try experimental antibodies. This proposal clearly does not work with cancer cells that do not have a targetable mutation.

What about losing the endogenous immune response from the steroid treatment? A possible solution is to alternate: one week or month you give modified antibodies and the engineered cells that respond to them; the next you give normal IgG antibodies or other approaches that use endogenous immune system.

This is a massive proposal. This would require significant funding and the concerted effort of many scientists and engineers, but I think it is worth it. Plus, it could be combined with many other approaches.
